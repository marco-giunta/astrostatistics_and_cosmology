# Astrostatistics & Cosmology
Exercises for the Astostatistics & Cosmology course @ UniPD

The two folders contain the $\LaTeX$ source of exercises 4 to 12 (they were pen & paper style exercises).
Exercise 7 is a coding exercise about MCMC; its R solution is available in notebook format.

homework_astrostatistics.pdf contains the assignments; finally `plot_mvn.py` is a short python script I used to quickly prototype the covariance matrix
to be used in Metropolis' proposal distribution.
