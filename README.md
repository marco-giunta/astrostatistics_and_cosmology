# Astrostatistics & Cosmology
Exercises for the Astostatistics & Cosmology course @ UniPD

- The first folder contains the `Rmd` source for the R/python solution of ex. 1.
- The second and third folders contain the $\LaTeX$ source of exercises 4 to 12 (they were pen & paper style exercises).
- The last folder contains the $\LaTeX$ source of the beamer used during the exam to discuss the paper *astroABC: An Approximate Bayesian Computation Sequential Monte Carlo sampler for cosmological parameter estimation* by E. Jennings and M. Madigan ([doi](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ascom.2017.01.001) and [arxiv preprint](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.1608.07606)). There is also a short python notebook that produces the plot used in the beamer.
- Exercise 7 is a coding exercise about MCMC; its R solution is available in notebook format (`astrostat_ex7_R.ipynb`).

homework_astrostatistics.pdf contains the assignments; finally `plot_mvn.py` is a short python script I used to quickly prototype the covariance matrix
to be used in Metropolis' proposal distribution.
